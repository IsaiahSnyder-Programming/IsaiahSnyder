# Hello There ðŸ‘‹

My name is Isaiah Snyder, currently a student at Boise CodeWorks. I come from a background in design and production. I have goals to become a fullstack developer, with my primary love being in UI/UX and backend technologies. I am very logically driven, and am driven to learn the way both technology and people work in harmony. I have taken a few courses outside of Boise CodeWorks, but have never done something this in-depth or intensive, so I am excited to see where it takes me.

I am currently in a couple of development teams in progress of multiple indie game projects ranging from simple 2D platformers to large, complicated open worlds, and am excited to see where that takes me in the future.

Ultimately I love to see the success of others, and strive to push both people and projects forward to become better versions of themselves.
